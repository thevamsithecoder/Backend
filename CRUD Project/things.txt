app.use require a middleware function

controlles : logic : connect with the database 

when we use authentication everthing will be private 

post method we can add things in the body : req.body we can print it will show undefined
it showed error because we havent added parser, so when we send data from the client(here body)
we need a body parser which is  a middleware

what is error handling in express ?
all the fields are required name,age, number, if any of this is not present then throw error

 npm run dev run the project

const createContact = (req, res)=>{
    const {name, age, email} = req.body;
    if(!name || !age || !email) {
       //res.status(400).json({error : "All fields are mandatory!"})
       res.status(400);
       throw new Error("All fields are mandatory!"); 
    }
    console.log("the request body is ", req.body);
    res.status(200).json({message : "create contact"});
}
Error: All fields are mandatory! I am getting an error like this with the HTML code so that


I will create a error file where I handle my error codes 400, 404 

const constants = {
    VALIDATION_ERROR : 400,
    UNAUTHORIZED : 401,
    FORBIDDEN : 403,
    NOT_FOUND : 404,
    SERVER_ERROR : 500
}

module.exports = constants;


when we use async we should use them in try catch block so that error will be arrested but 
instead of using try catch block we have to install something called





authentication:
library is bcrypt, which is require for signup,
jwt.io, it is require for signin 
auth-bearer section I have to add the token 

get the access token and use it in cotact route
